        <p> The Brew Crew was formed in the Fall of 2011. The team was put together by manager Kevin P. and it comprised of players who played together from another Summer ball team, The Dodgers. Many of the Dodger players were looking for a way to continue playing the sport they loved so much for longer in the year as well as unwinding on Sundays after the work week. The team, comprised of mostly players from the "Uptown"/Washington Heights and Bronx areas of NYC, joined the <a href="http://citysoftball.com"> Inwood Fall Softball League</a> that first year, and have never looked back.</p>
      
        <p>The team has continued to build upon their first Fall ball squad and have returned every year in different iterations to play in the Inwood Fall League. The name of the team has become so synonymous with the core group of players that have been around since day 1, that the team has officially become the Brew Crew for both Summer and Fall ball.</p>
