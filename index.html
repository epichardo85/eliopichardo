          The Brew Crew's run at a Fall Ball championship came to end in the semi-final round of the Inwood Fall League after a 
          decisive game 3 loss to The Sandlot squad, on Sunday, November 5th. After some hard fought games, the Crew's run ultimately fell short. 
          The team will be hard at work during the offseason to continue building for the next season in the Spring/Summer of 2018. </p>

        <p> The Brew Crew was formed in the Fall of 2011. The team was put together by manager Kevin P. and it comprised of players who played together from another Summer Ball team, The Dodgers. Many of the Dodger players were looking for a way to continue playing the sport they loved so much for longer in the year as well as unwinding on Sundays after the work week. The team, comprised of mostly players from the "Uptown"/Washington Heights and Bronx areas of NYC, joined the <a href="http://citysoftball.com"> Inwood Fall Softball League</a> that first year, and have never looked back.</p>
      
        <p>The team has continued to build upon their first Fall Ball squad and have returned every year in different iterations to play in the Inwood Fall League. The name of the team has become so synonymous with the core group of players that have been around since Day 1, that the team has officially become the Brew Crew for both Summer and Fall ball.</p>
